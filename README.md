# MEAP: Memory Exercise for Alzheimer’s Patients 
## Introduction
MEAP is an iOS app designed for 10.5 inch iPad Pro for seniors in the early to mid stages of Alzheimer’s Disease. Its objective is cognitive stimulation through solving puzzles that exercise the patient’s Pattern Completion and Pattern Separation capabilities of their hippocampus. First, there are 10 Pattern Completion games. For each game, the user will be shown a pattern. Their role is to memorize it and recover the complete pattern from its partial pattern shown. Secondly, there are 15 Pattern Separation games. For each game, the user will be asked to categorize a picture as OLD, NEW or SIMILAR. After each game stage, the user is assigned a score and is able to view how they performed on each game. MEAP also records user history: their best score, all the final scores for each game play and the number of games played per day. This data is represented graphically under History so that the user is able to check their progress in the game. Note that the trends shown do not make any diagnosis about the user’s level of  Alzheimer's, it is simply to keep track of their performance within MEAP.
